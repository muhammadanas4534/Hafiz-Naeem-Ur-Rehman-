<h1><hr>2020 protest against K-Electric<hr></h1>
<p>Naeem has led many protests against Karachi's electric utility company K-Electric, due to government's alleged favoritism to the
     utility company, and its dis-service to the people of Karachi in terms of not returning its consumers their money under a claw-back
     clause applicable to the company. Naeem claimed the company's Rs 9 billion profits in 2020, were at a cost of large subsidies
     received from the government, which costed tax payers money to benefit the owners of the utility company.[13] Naeem also
     demanded a forensic audit of K-Electric, claiming that the utility company has been in close relations with all ruling political 
     parties, and alleged that the company enjoyed benefits from the ruling parties.
